# Media Player - Loop machine 

This project has eight different channels that together create a sound segment.
There are three buttons that allow the user to control the playlist- play, stop, and loop.
Once you click the stop button, the sound segments will reset.
When the loop button is pressed - the playlist will start again once it reaches the end.
Additionally to the mentioned above, each audio has a mute button that allows you to mute each channel individually.
